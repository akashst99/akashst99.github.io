                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In the recent decades color psychology has 
                    been a popular field for researches to research,
                    The research in color psychology isn't new, a researcher forms
                    1942 postulated certain colors illicited emotional response.
                    Reasearchers Elliot and Maier have sought color-incontext theory 
                    which postulates that people tend to associate colors with particular 
                    concepts and experiences. An example of this theory is how people pair 
                    color blue on ribbon as positive while blue on meat as negative (Elliot, 2015).</p>
                    <p>Accordig to a hubspot article written by Cartwright. "If you’re 
                        looking to create a feeling of peace or tranquility, trend 
                        toward lighter blues and greens"(Cartwright, 2022). Article from Platt College also mentions
                        how green, blue and even purple are calming colors.(Englehardt, 2016). According to Hale,
                        "navy blue, closely followed by teal-like turquoise, and soft pastel pink"(Hale, 2019).</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>However, little research
                        has been done on the impact of colours in Internet-based environ-
                        ments and only a handful of researchers have conducted studies on
                        this topic in recent years e.g.(Bonnardel et al., 2011). 
                        They decided to research on wheather website users and designers 
                        found the same color scheme appealing. The researchers developed an 
                        experimental site with 23 version of homepage in which users had to indicate
                        how much they liked the webpage from scale 7-1, 7 being liked the most and 1 being 
                        not at all. The researchers found, "the professional designers appeared to be more critical of
                        the Webpages than the users. However, blue and orange were re-
                        garded as the most appealing colours by all participants, whatever
                        their status. Website designers also liked (or at least did not dis-
                        like) grey, unlike the users."(Bonnardel et al., 2011).</p>
                <p>For my mock research project I would like to conduct a similar study to Bonnard's
                
                    research but instead of investigating what colors website users and developers prefer,
                    I want to investigate what color scheme is the calmnest and I only want to focus primarily on 
                    website users for my mock study. For my study I would like to only use 4 different colors
                    for sake of simplicity and time. I hypothesise that the blue color scheme will make users feel
                    the most calmn since articles have mentioned the color navy blue is considered to be the calmnest
                    and the research conducted by Bonnardel found people prefred the color blue home page over all the colors.
