        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The research in color theory about the relationship between colors and
          human emotions is old. Researchers only recently began investigating
          this complex relationship in the context of digital media. The purpose
          of this study is not to make a statistical claim for the general human
          population but rather for individuals who participated in this study.
          This study investigates what color scheme variant the participants
          found the most calming on a web page. The color schemes used for this
          study are pink, blue, purple, and green variants of the same web page.
          Our study found that participants rated green and blue as the most
          calming color schemes. A larger pool of participants is needed to
          confirm the hypotheses.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          This mock research project aims to determine which color scheme on a
          web page is the most calming. In recent decades, color psychology has
          been a growing field of research. According to the academic paper by
          Andrew J Elliot, the research in color psychology can be traced back
          to researcher Goethe in 1810, who associated colors with emotional
          responses. In 1942, researcher Bob Goldstein expanded the ideas by
          postulating that certain colors elicited specific emotional reactions.
          Goldstein also posited that shorter wavelength colors feel relaxing
          while longer wavelengths feel warm and arousing. In 2012 Elliot and
          Maier synthesized color-in-context theory, which postulates that
          people associate colors with particular concepts and experiences. An
          example of this theory is how people pair the color blue on a ribbon
          as positive while blue on meat as negative (Elliot, 2015).

        <br />
        <p>
          Various articles recite studies that have found colors invoking a
          specific emotional response. According to a HubSpot article written by
          Bethany Cartwright. “If you’re looking to create a feeling of peace or
          tranquility, trend toward lighter blues and greens” (Cartwright,
          2022). An article from Platt College also mentions how green, blue,
          and even purple are calming colors. (Englehardt, 2016). Hale states,
          “navy blue, closely followed by teal-like turquoise, and soft pastel
          pink” (Hale, 2019).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, more research needs to be done on the impact of colors in
          Internet-based environments, with only a few researchers conducting
          studies on this topic in recent years (e.g. Bonnardel et al., 2011).
          They decided to research whether website users and designers found the
          same color scheme appealing. Researchers developed 23 homepage
          variants in which users had to indicate how much they liked the
          webpage on a scale of 1-7, 7 being liked the most and 1 not at all.
          The researchers found that “the professional designers appeared to be
          more critical of the Webpages than the users. However, blue and orange
          were regarded as the most appealing colors by all participants.
          Website designers also liked (or at least did not dis- like) grey,
          unlike the users” (Bonnardel et al., 2011).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is similar to Bonnardel’s research, but instead of investigating
          what colors website users and developers prefer, this project investigates what
          color scheme is the calmest and focuses primarily on website users. This
          study only uses four different colors for simplicity and time. Due to
          the results from the University of Sussex and G F Smith's survey, the
          hypothesis proposed is that the participants will rate the color blue to be the
          most calming.

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to identify what color feels the most calming, four variants
          of the same webpage were developed using a code editing software known
          as Visual Studio Code. A monochromatic color scheme for all four
          variants of the experimental web pages was chosen to cancel out
          confounding variables. HTML and CSS were used to build the website for
          this study. These experimental web page variants are the home page for
          a fictional AI art generator company, Happy Art, that has been
          synthesized for this project. Each experimental web page has two
          shades of the same color to differentiate the navigation bar from the
          body of the experimental web pages. The navigation bar of the
          experimental web pages has a darker shade than the body. Happy Art is
          intended to allow participants to select six themes for the AI to
          generate an artwork specific to the theme the participants have
          selected. The theme selector does not generate artwork but directs
          participants to the last section of the web page. This section
          contains a big red button, which, when clicked, redirects users to
          the main home page of the research project. Once the participants have
          visited all the web pages, they click the yellow link from the
          main home page, leading them to the google survey. They rate
          each experimental web page using a 5-point Likert scale (1 being the
          least calm and 5 being the calmest). After filling out the google
          survey, the participants completed the required tasks for this mock
          research project.

        <br />
        <p>
          Based on the survey, users rated green and blue as the most calming
          web page color schemes. Two participants rated green and blue as 5,
          and one rated pink as 5. One person rated pink as 4, and three
          participants rated blue, purple, and green as 4. One rated pink as 3,
          and four participants rated blue and green as 4. Five participants
          rated purple as 3, and one rated blue and green as 2. In contrast,
          four participants rated pink as 2, and one rated purple as 2. Nobody
          rated blue as 1, while one person rated purple and green as 1. Two
          people ranked pink as 1. Four participants rated pink as 2, and two
          ranked pink as 4, suggesting that participants generally found pink to
          be the least calming color scheme. Purple got the most consistent
          rating of 3 from five participants, suggesting purple has an average
          calming effect on the participants.

        <h2>Discussion/Conclusion</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The outcome of this project shows that participants found both the
          green and blue color schemes to be the calmest. This finding is
          similar to other findings, which suggest that light blue and green
          colors tend to be calming. It was not surprising that participants
          rated the pink color scheme as the least calming since the color was
          bright as opposed to pastel pink.

        <br />
        <p>
          A few things could be improved for this project. The number of
          participants was too small to make a statistical claim, so future
          studies would need a more significant number of participants. A random
          sampling method for this research project was not used. Further
          testing would be recommended to improve this study's results' accuracy
          and depth.
